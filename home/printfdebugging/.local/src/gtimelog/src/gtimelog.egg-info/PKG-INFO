A Gtk+ time tracking application.

Changes in version 0.6.0 (not released yet)
==============================================

* Ported from PyGTK to GI. This supports GTK 2 and GTK 3 with GI now, but still
  works with PyGTK.

  Packager's note: If you want to use GI, you need to change the package's
  dependencies from pygtk to the package that provides the GTK and Pango
  typelibs (e. g. gir1.2-gtk-2.0 and gir1.2-pango-1.0 on Debian/Ubuntu). It
  also requires pygobject >= 2.27.1.

  Contributed by Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>.

* Hide the main window on Esc.  Fixes LP: #716257.

Changes in version 0.5.0 (released 2011-01-28)
==============================================

* Switched from Glade to GtkBuilder.  This fixes those strange theme problems
  GTimeLog had with Ubuntu's Radiance and especially Ambiance. (LP: #644393)

  Packagers note: src/gtimelog/gtimelog.glade is gone, it was replaced by
  src/gtimelog/gtimelog.ui.  It needs to be installed into
  /usr/share/gtimelog/.

* GTimeLog now supports Ubuntu's application indicators.  There's a new
  configuration option, ``prefer_app_indicator``, defaulting to true.
  Fixes LP: #523461.

* GTimeLog tries to detect your theme color and make the tray icon dark or
  bright, for good contrast.  This is a hack that doesn't work reliably, but
  is better than nothing.  Fixes LP: #700428.

  Packagers note: there's a new icon file,
  src/gtimelog/gtimelog-small-bright.png.  It needs to be installed into
  /usr/share/gtimelog/.

* Made GTimeLog a single instance application.  Requires python-dbus.
  The following command line options are supported::

    gtimelog --ignore-dbus
        always launch a new application instance, do not start the DBus service

    gtimelog --toggle
        if GtimeLog already running, show or hide the GTimeLog window,
        otherwise launch a new application instance

    gtimelog
        if GtimeLog already running, bring the GTimeLog window to the front,
        otherwise launch a new application instance

  Contributed by Bruce van der Kooij (https://launchpad.net/~brucevdk),
  Fixes LP: #356495.

* New option: start_in_tray.  Defaults to false.  Contributed by Bruce van der
  Kooij (https://launchpad.net/~brucevdk), as part of his patch for LP:
  #356495.

* New command-line option: --tray.  Makes GTimeLog start minimized, or exit
  without doing anything if it's already running.

* Added some documentation for contributors: HACKING.txt.

* Daily reports include totals by category.  Contributed by Laurynas Speičys
  <laurynas@pov.lt>.

* The tasks pane can be toggled by pressing F9 and has a close button.

* Alternative weekly and monthly report style, can be chosen by adding
  ``report_style = categorized`` to ~/.gtimelog/gtimelogrc.
  Contributed by Laurynas Speičys <laurynas@pov.lt>.

* Bugfix: always preserve the order of entries, even when they have the same
  timestamp (LP: #708825).


Changes in version 0.4.0 (released 2010-09-03)
==============================================

* Added configuration variable 'chronological' to control initial view of
  either Chronological (True) or Grouped (False).  Contributed by Barry Warsaw
  <barry@python.org> (LP: #628876)

* Recognize $GTIMELOG_HOME environment variable to use something other than
  ~/.gtimelog as the configuration directory.  Contributed by Barry Warsaw
  <barry@python.org> (LP: #628873)

* Changed application name to 'GTimeLog Time Tracker' in the desktop file
  (Debian #595280)
